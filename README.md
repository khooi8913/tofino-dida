# DIDA
This repository holds the Tofino (follow up) implementation for DIDA, proposed in the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9165488), `DIDA: Distributed In-Network Defense Architecture Against Amplified Reflection DDoS Attacks` accepted at IEEE NetSoft 2020.

The BMv2 implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/khooi8913/bmv2-dida).

## Usage/ Notes
It is assumed that you have access to Intel's P4 Studio.

Please see either `v1/` and `v2/` for the distributed architecture; the all-in-one variants, `v3/` and `v4` were intended for internal studies.
